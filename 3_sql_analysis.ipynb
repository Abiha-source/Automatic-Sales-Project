# 3. SQL-Based Analysis

```python

# 2. Monthly average sales in Recession vs Non-Recession
query2 = """

This script:
- Creates a SQLite database from the cleaned DataFrame
- Runs SQL queries to get key insights:
  - Average sales by vehicle type
  - Monthly average sales during recession vs non-recession
  - Months with highest advertisement spending
